# Jade Project Kickstart

A quick and dirty template for web development with Jade, Less and other convenient tasks.

You will need Node.js and Grunt. To start-up, simply run:

```
$ npm install
$ grunt
```

Assets will be compiled and a new web server spawned to serve files with LiveReload support. Enjoy your awesome new development environment!
